## Verified code/test checkpoint and documentation-refresh status — 2026-10-24

- The most recent code/test checkpoint is `703a7d380a63f0d379ca17f0b920279597ea58be`; it passed all three validation workflows: [automation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084232036), [metadata](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084232050), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084232178). Logs show 112 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; Python safety tests and syntax/compilation checks also passed.
- A subsequent documentation-only refresh on this branch updated the evidence sections. Its current branch HEAD and its own CI runs are recorded in PR #1; do not mistake the code/test checkpoint above for the documentation commit SHA.
- The [lockfile workflow](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084228825) passed on the code/test checkpoint, including `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, Node tests, schedule/campaign validation and syntax checks. Plain `npm ci` without `--ignore-scripts` remains unverified.
- The latest verified automation audit reports four moderate npm advisories involving `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common` and `uuid`, with no high/critical findings. The available Google API client fix is a major version upgrade and needs compatibility testing. Do not describe dependencies as vulnerability-free.
- Production acceptance remains blocked by the cadence decision, genuine rights-cleared media and manifests, full decode and human playback review bound to final hashes, secure live SonicVhibez OAuth identity verification, one explicitly authorized private upload with a remotely verified private-status receipt, and owner-run restart/backup-restore acceptance. Safari remains inactive until exact HTTPS destination, truthful disclosure and explicit owner approval exist.
- Public publishing remains disabled. The Tuesday/Saturday 1-long-form + 1-Short schedule is an interim draft-only fallback; the requested 2-long-form + 1-Short weekly cadence conflicts with 72-hour cyclic spacing and requires an explicit owner decision.

## Historical checkpoint — superseded by the current verified baseline above

The code/test commit `62b1bd599d63c3ab1d55b6a6660740fbf3d44157` passed all three GitHub Actions validation workflows with 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped in each: [automation validation and clean install](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495157), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495128), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495162). The automation run completed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (46 packages added, 47 audited) and Python compilation.

The later documentation checkpoint `b505a260570afb23de637d599868e55376a827aa` also passed all three workflows with 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped: [automation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034769), [metadata/schedule](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034706), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034728). It was documentation-only relative to the tested code/test commit.

The implemented safeguards include: full production preflight at dashboard readiness; required operator identity in audit events; rights-record hash verification and rechecking retained source/licence file checksums before upload; checksummed backup/restore of state, audit history, rights records, review approvals, upload attempts and receipts; and fail-closed refusal to overwrite a different upload ledger. `.gitignore` excludes local secrets, state, rights records, backups and generated media.

These are automated/code-level checks, not proof of genuine licence authenticity, human playback review, real wildlife renders or a live YouTube upload. Public publishing remains disabled; PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged.

## Previous implementation checkpoint (superseded by current code/test checkpoint below) — 2026-10-24

Code and regression-test commit: `6b0874b870343cf435099eedf74038bf2e01f58c`. The three GitHub Actions validation workflows passed on this exact commit: 95 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped in each workflow. [Automation validation and clean install](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40077083877), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40077083898), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40077083943). The automation workflow completed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and installed/audited 46 packages.

The dashboard `/readyz` endpoint now runs the full production-readiness preflight, includes actionable blockers, and returns HTTP 503 with `ready: false` when owner-controlled or production prerequisites remain unmet. This is not proof of real wildlife media, license authenticity, human playback review, live OAuth identity, or a real YouTube upload. Public publishing remains disabled and PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged.


## Previous acceptance checkpoint (superseded by the latest code checkpoint below) — 2026-10-24

Tested implementation commit: `c39c3b88eefb3430dcfedbc0663bef33ad03f45c`. GitHub Actions ran the full Node suite at this commit: 95 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. [Automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40037943712), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40037943732), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40037943766) all passed. The automation workflow also completed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` successfully.

Short and long-form renderers now fail closed on technical export validation errors. This code-test result does not mean a genuine wildlife MP4 was produced: the production manifests and rights-cleared assets are still absent. No live OAuth identity, real private upload, or remote receipt is claimed. Public publishing remains disabled; PR #1 remains draft and unmerged.

## Coverage represented by automated tests

- Dashboard authentication, local state persistence, real draft operations, campaign state operations and audit history.
- Cross-process slot reservation, idempotent creation, schedule-date validation, lease transitions and stale worker protection.
- Rights evidence shape, review checksum binding and blocked attempts to bypass review.
- Private-only uploader preconditions, authenticated channel identity checks, durable pre-upload ledger, uncertain remote timeout, receipt persistence failure, reconciliation-only recovery and no blind retry.
- Campaign separation, exact Selar URL, inactive Safari defaults, schedule/workflow agreement and public publishing disabled.
- Caption, metadata and asset-register preflight.

## Important limits

- GitHub Actions tests exercise mock YouTube clients for failure scenarios; they are not proof of a real external YouTube integration.
- `npm ci --ignore-scripts` was run; plain `npm ci` without `--ignore-scripts` is not separately claimed.
- No production wildlife MP4, actual thumbnail or real-media checksum/duration/dimensions are claimed because legitimate assets and rights evidence were unavailable.
- Live OAuth identity verification, real private upload, remote receipt verification and real-world rights validation remain blocked on owner-provided prerequisites.
- The test suite does not turn public publishing on; it remains disabled.


## Acceptance gate references

See [GO_LIVE_BLOCKERS.md](GO_LIVE_BLOCKERS.md) for current owner-dependent blockers and [RELEASE_GATE_CHECKLIST.md](RELEASE_GATE_CHECKLIST.md) for the exact evidence required before release. No live-media render or live private upload is claimed. Public publishing remains disabled.


## Previous branch-head CI checkpoint (superseded)

Docs-only branch head `460f57fdddc48b8eb163ba452e6044a434c0bceb` passed all three validation workflows with 95 passed, 0 failed and 0 skipped: [automation validation and clean install](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40073783190), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40073783221), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40073783180). The workflow ran `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and reported 46 packages added/audited. Plain `npm ci` without the flag remains unverified. These tests do not prove real media rendering or a live YouTube upload.


## Historical implementation checkpoint — superseded by the current verified baseline above

- Tested code/workflow HEAD: `4ba995bc51ed2ae0513bc312865713a73e0e3160` (timezone-aware local-time conversion plus the 72-hour weekly schedule guard).
- [Automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305593), [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305540), and [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305556) all passed on that code HEAD. Each ran 106 tests: 106 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. Automation also passed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (46 packages added, 47 audited) and Python safety tests. Metadata validation explicitly confirms that `npm run check` fails closed while real production metadata is incomplete; this is not a release-readiness pass.
- Planned draft slots are Tuesday 17:00 and Saturday 17:00 Africa/Johannesburg. The cyclic gaps are 96 hours and 72 hours. The validator checks the weekly UTC schedule and queue collisions; actual public/private/unlisted upload history and live destination queue must still be inspected before any publication.
- PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged. Public publishing remains disabled. No production MP4, thumbnail, rights clearance, human playback acceptance, live OAuth identity check, private upload receipt, or owner-run restore acceptance is claimed.
- Remaining owner-controlled gates: genuine rights-cleared source assets and completed manifests; rendered/decoded media and human review; secure OAuth identity verification for SonicVhibez; explicit per-operation private-upload authorization; operational backup/restore acceptance. Safari remains inactive until exact destination, disclosure, and owner approval exist.

## Verified branch-head checkpoint — 2026-10-24 (documentation commit pending revalidation)

- Exact tested code HEAD: `7b5a97da38a9716f49b19682c117f1b8a195afe4`; base `main` SHA: `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`.
- The three PR workflows completed successfully on that exact HEAD: [automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40083885872), [metadata validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40083885858), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40083885897).
- Automation job evidence: Node test suite reported 112 tests, 112 passed, 0 failed; queue invariant check confirmed 16 held/review-state topics, the exact approved Selar destination, and publishing disabled. JavaScript syntax checks and Python compilation completed successfully. Install path was `npm ci --ignore-scripts`.
- Dependency audit: 4 moderate findings, 0 high, 0 critical. Reported paths/advisories include `gaxios` (range 6.4.0–6.7.1, fix available via `uuid`), `googleapis` (range 33.0.0–149.0.0; suggested fix `googleapis@178.0.0`, a major upgrade), `googleapis-common` (<=7.2.0; major-upgrade fix path), and `uuid` (<11.1.1; buffer-bounds-check issue). Do not call the dependency tree vulnerability-free; compatibility assessment and remediation remain open. CI deliberately warns rather than suppressing the audit.
- This checkpoint verifies automated repository checks only. It does not establish plain `npm ci`, live OAuth, genuine rights clearance, actual production media, human playback acceptance, a live private upload, or operator-run restore acceptance.
- The report was updated after the above test runs. Any commit containing this documentation update must be revalidated independently; these links apply to `7b5a97da38a9716f49b19682c117f1b8a195afe4`, not to a later documentation commit.
