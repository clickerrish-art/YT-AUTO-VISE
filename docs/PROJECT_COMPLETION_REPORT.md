# Project Completion Report — SonicVhibez Marketing Machine

## Latest code/test checkpoint — 2026-10-24

Code and regression-test commit: `68cb2359628ca069e33f7de905b10183989f53e1`. The three GitHub Actions validation workflows are running for this exact commit: [automation validation](`https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40078895025`), [metadata/schedule validation](`https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40078895040`), and [content quality](`https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40078895024`). The prior code/test commit `6e56b240868c07cb5207fe8fa7f13a8b664be376` passed all three workflows with 99 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; `npm ci --ignore-scripts` installed 46 packages and audited 47, and Python compilation passed. The new candidate adds one regression test for Git-ignored local secrets/state/media and is awaiting these final runs.

Code additions since the prior checkpoint: upload preflight now verifies the approval-bound rights record hash and current source/licence-file checksums; dashboard audit events use the required `DASHBOARD_OPERATOR_ID`; per-asset rights records retain reviewer and timestamp; `backup:state` and guarded `restore:state` preserve dashboard state/audit, upload attempts/receipts/approvals and retained rights files. Restore validates checksums, requires explicit confirmation, and refuses to overwrite a different existing upload ledger. `.gitignore` excludes local secrets, state, rights documents, backups and generated production media.

These automated checks do not prove genuine licence authenticity, real wildlife media or live YouTube upload acceptance. Public publishing remains disabled; PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged.

## Previous implementation checkpoint (superseded by current code/test checkpoint below) — 2026-10-24

Code and regression-test commit: `6b0874b870343cf435099eedf74038bf2e01f58c`. The three GitHub Actions validation workflows passed on this exact commit: 95 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped in each workflow. [Automation validation and clean install](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40077083877), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40077083898), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40077083943). The automation workflow completed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and installed/audited 46 packages.

The dashboard `/readyz` endpoint now runs the full production-readiness preflight, includes its actionable blockers, and returns HTTP 503 with `ready: false` when owner-controlled or production prerequisites remain unmet. The new regression test verifies this fail-closed behavior. This is not proof of real wildlife media, license authenticity, human playback review, live OAuth identity, or a real YouTube upload. Public publishing remains disabled and PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged.


## Previous acceptance checkpoint (superseded by the latest code checkpoint below) — 2026-10-24

Tested implementation commit: `c39c3b88eefb3430dcfedbc0663bef33ad03f45c`. GitHub Actions ran the full Node suite at this commit: 95 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. [Automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40037943712), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40037943732), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40037943766) all passed. The automation workflow also completed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` successfully.

Short and long-form renderers now fail closed on technical export validation errors. This code-test result does not mean a genuine wildlife MP4 was produced: the production manifests and rights-cleared assets are still absent. No live OAuth identity, real private upload, or remote receipt is claimed. Public publishing remains disabled; PR #1 remains draft and unmerged.

## Implemented and tested

- Durable local dashboard state, authenticated API access, loopback-only binding, health/readiness endpoints and audit events.
- Date-specific draft reservations with idempotency, conflict detection and cross-process state locking.
- Fixed, typed dashboard tasks for schedule checks, caption checks, readiness diagnostics, tests and Short/long-form renderers; no browser-triggered arbitrary shell command.
- Both Short and long-form renderers run fail-closed technical export validation before reporting success; checks include duration, resolution/orientation, codecs, audio presence, full-file decode, and measurable audio for Shorts. The dashboard separately verifies checksums, metadata, captions and thumbnail. Real media production remains blocked without rights-cleared inputs.
- Technical validation rechecks media checksums, metadata version and caption structure before rights review.
- Rights verification records each source asset and evidence file, their checksums, permitted uses, restrictions, attribution requirements, verifier and timestamp.
- Human review is authenticated and bound to the actual MP4 checksum, thumbnail, metadata version and verified rights-evidence hash. The resulting approval JSON is persisted under `run-logs/upload-approvals/`.
- The uploader validates all approval-bound files, confirms the authenticated channel ID and exact channel title, writes an attempt ledger before upload, forces `privacyStatus: private`, re-fetches the remote item and verifies channel/privacy, and enters recovery rather than blindly retrying uncertain outcomes.
- Campaign operations are separated: Selar uses the exact approved destination; Safari remains inactive until an exact HTTPS destination and disclosure are previewed and owner-approved.
- `package-lock.json` is committed and clean install was exercised with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`.

## Acceptance checklist

- **PASS:** correct weekly schedule; draft-only workflows; exact Selar URL; public publishing disabled.
- **PASS:** dashboard integration/authentication, durable drafts, schedule-slot conflict protection, campaign operations and fail-closed rendering paths.
- **PASS:** automated private-uploader mock tests for remote timeout, receipt persistence failure, remote reconciliation, private visibility checks and duplicate-prevention behavior.
- **BLOCKED:** actual rights-cleared Short/long-form MP4 generation and human playback inspection. No genuine production media, checksum, duration or dimensions are claimed.
- **BLOCKED:** live OAuth channel identity verification and real private upload. No credentials or real YouTube upload receipt were available in this implementation environment.
- **BLOCKED:** Safari activation until owner supplies the exact destination and disclosure.
- **NOT CLAIMED:** unattended public posting, automatic visibility changes, or 100% production readiness.

## Media evidence

No genuine wildlife documentary MP4 or production thumbnail was generated during this run because legitimate media inputs and verified rights evidence were not supplied. The render path is implemented and tested to block missing or invalid inputs; test fixtures are not represented as documentary output.

## Owner actions to clear blockers

1. Supply licensed footage, narration and any music, with original permission/license evidence and stable checksums.
2. Fill both render manifests with real files and evidence; generate and inspect actual MP4s with FFmpeg/ffprobe and by playback.
3. Configure secure local dashboard credentials and operator identity.
4. Independently confirm SonicVhibez's channel ID through the authenticated YouTube API and store OAuth credentials only in secure environment variables or GitHub Actions secrets.
5. Complete artifact-bound rights verification and review, then authorize an explicit private-only upload.
6. Supply and approve Safari's exact HTTPS destination and disclosure if that campaign is desired.

PR #1 remains open and draft. Do not merge or enable public publishing as part of this work.

## Previous branch-head CI checkpoint (superseded)

Docs-only branch head `460f57fdddc48b8eb163ba452e6044a434c0bceb` passed the three validation workflows with 95 passed, 0 failed and 0 skipped: [automation validation and clean install](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40073783190), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40073783221), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40073783180). This was a documentation-only commit after the tested runtime implementation `c39c3b88eefb3430dcfedbc0663bef33ad03f45c`; the live-media and private-upload gates remain blocked.
