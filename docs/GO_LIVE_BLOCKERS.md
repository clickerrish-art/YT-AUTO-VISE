# CURRENT ACCEPTANCE EVIDENCE — 2026-10-24 (live re-check)

This snapshot was refreshed from GitHub during the current audit. It records the observed state before this documentation edit; the resulting documentation commit and its own CI must be checked separately before calling this snapshot current.

- Observed PR #1 head: `df70ec63344501106d8b40e4c43ee71f675da6da`; PR remains open, draft and unmerged: https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/pull/1.
- Default branch HEAD: `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6`; merge base: `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`; live compare: 859 commits ahead, 2 behind. This large divergence is not resolved. Do not merge/rebase or rewrite history without owner review.
- Exact-head PR workflow results observed for `df70ec63344501106d8b40e4c43ee71f675da6da`:
  - [Automation validation — run 40115828675](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40115828675): success; 197 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; 8 Python safety tests passed; campaign/queue checks, JavaScript syntax and Python compilation passed.
  - [Content quality — run 40115828668](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40115828668): success; 197 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
  - [Metadata validation — run 40115828706](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40115828706): success; 197 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; schedule/caption checks passed and production readiness remained blocked.
  - [Facebook daily draft — run 40115828664](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40115828664): skipped on the PR event. This is not a default-branch scheduled workflow acceptance.
  - Combined commit status endpoint returned no status entries. The three named PR workflow runs above are the positive evidence available; do not infer that every required check ran.
- The automation workflow used `npm ci --ignore-scripts`; its audit reported 4 moderate, 0 high and 0 critical advisories involving `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common` and `uuid`. The available Google API fix requires a major upgrade and has not been applied without compatibility testing. Unrestricted lifecycle-script installation was not tested.
- Code review confirms Facebook live publishing is disabled in config, dry-run is enabled, and the emergency stop is on. The production queue is empty. The publisher does not inject a trusted semantic verifier, so factual posts fail closed. The intake validates supplied candidates but does not independently research claims and obtain genuine media rights.
- No real Meta Page identity/permissions, persistent production runner, remote Facebook receipt, SonicVhibez OAuth/history reconciliation, authorized private YouTube upload/receipt, or owner-run isolated restore drill has been verified. Public YouTube publishing remains disabled; Safari campaigns remain inactive; the approved Selar URL remains exactly `https://selar.com/0u19v8u99l`.
- Historical test-file incident: base-only commit `71578dafc24e5d48173dce3f4e392e18e42aa40e` added `test/restore-facebook-draft-history.test.mjs`, and `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6` reverted it. Preserve this history for owner review; equivalent cross-run coverage is claimed in daily-draft tests, but the incident itself remains visible.

**Decision: PRODUCTION ACCEPTANCE BLOCKED.** This is a code/test evidence snapshot, not proof of external account operation or production readiness.

# CURRENT ACCEPTANCE EVIDENCE — 2026-10-24

This is the current dated evidence snapshot. Older checkpoints below are historical only. If the branch advances, consult PR #1 and the exact-SHA Actions results before treating this snapshot as current.

- Latest exact-SHA verified PR head at this checkpoint: `5a542fd702aee926515718027af850e34a0dc325` (documentation-only refresh). The executable-code change and regression test are in parent candidate `249558377b71eec7b793ad2667bac3cee5594a13`; the report-refresh commit changed this report only.
- PR #1 is open, draft and unmerged: https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/pull/1.
- Live branch comparison: 758 commits ahead and 2 behind `main`; current `main` HEAD `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6`; merge base `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`; 80 changed files.
- Security implementation: `scripts/dashboard-server.mjs` resolves operator-supplied repository-relative file paths to canonical paths and rejects symlink targets outside the repository. `test/dashboard-server.test.mjs` tests this through the authenticated HTTP upload-reconciliation endpoint using a temporary external fixture; the request is rejected before reconciliation. The earlier dashboard state-path disclosure fix remains covered by HTTP integration assertions.
- Exact-SHA CI for report-refresh candidate `5a542fd702aee926515718027af850e34a0dc325`:
  - Automation validation [run 40108268034](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40108268034): PASS — 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed; 8 Python safety tests passed; queue/campaign checks, JavaScript syntax and Python compilation passed.
  - Content quality [run 40108268023](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40108268023): PASS — 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Metadata validation [run 40108268048](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40108268048): PASS — 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed; schedule and caption validation passed; readiness correctly remains blocked.
  - Nature Frontiers daily Facebook draft [run 40108268027](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40108268027): SKIPPED on the PR branch; this is not default-branch production acceptance.
- Dependency audit from run 40108268034: 4 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical advisories. Affected packages: `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common`, and `uuid`. The available Google API remediation is a major upgrade to `googleapis@188.0.0`; it has not been applied without compatibility testing.
- Installation evidence uses `npm ci --ignore-scripts`; unrestricted lifecycle-script installation was not tested.
- Production acceptance remains BLOCKED: genuine licensed source media, complete render manifests/asset register and human playback review are missing; live SonicVhibez OAuth and complete channel-history reconciliation have not been verified; no explicitly authorized private upload or durable remote receipt exists; real Meta identity/default-branch artifact and owner-run backup/restore acceptance are unverified; dependency-risk disposition and branch-divergence review remain open.
- No real YouTube upload or Facebook post is claimed. Public YouTube publishing stays disabled; Facebook live publishing stays disabled/dry-run; Safari remains inactive. Do not merge or perform external mutations without the relevant explicit owner authorization.

# HISTORICAL CHECKPOINT — 2026-10-24 (superseded; retained for audit)

- Tested code SHA: `bb9c8d115979ab5aff48ed0ee3ca9afe1bc0fd05`; implementation branch `codex/marketing-machine-audit-fixes`.
- PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged: https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/pull/1.
- Branch comparison at this checkpoint: 746 commits ahead, 2 behind `main`; base HEAD `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6`. Preserve the accidental test-file add/delete incident for owner review; no merge or history rewrite was performed.
- Exact-SHA CI passed:
  - Automation validation [run 40100702894](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40100702894): 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed/skipped; 8 Python safety tests passed; `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, campaign/queue checks, JavaScript syntax and Python compilation passed.
  - Content quality [run 40100702959](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40100702959): 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed/skipped.
  - Metadata validation [run 40100702955](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40100702955): 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed/skipped; schedule validation, readiness and captions checks passed.
  - Nature Frontiers daily Facebook draft [run 40100702958](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40100702958): skipped on the PR branch; not default-branch acceptance.
- Rolling publication policy: `long_form → long_form → short`; minimum 72 elapsed hours between consecutive actual publications and 216 hours across the three cyclic gaps. Tuesday/Saturday triggers are draft preparation only. Completed ledger receipts are not re-counted as future slots; an exclusive upload lock prevents concurrent inserts and fails closed after a crash.
- Live uploads now require a separate one-shot authorization bound to the job ID, final video hash, metadata hash, approval hash and verified channel ID. Authorization ID is persisted before insert and cannot be reused. This automated gate does not replace live owner credentials, rights evidence or human approval.
- All eleven inspected workflows now use `actions/checkout@v7` and `actions/setup-node@v7` where applicable, with Node.js 24 and setup-node caching explicitly disabled. Package engine floor is Node.js >=22. The exact SHA above passed on those updated actions.
- Dependency audit remains 4 moderate, 0 high/critical: `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common`, `uuid`. No unsafe major dependency upgrade was applied.
- CI installation used `npm ci --ignore-scripts`; unrestricted lifecycle-script installation was not tested.
- Production acceptance remains BLOCKED: required real short/long manifests and asset register are absent, `media/next-short.mp4` is absent, genuine licence evidence and human final-hash playback approval are not available, live SonicVhibez OAuth/history reconciliation and a separately authorized private upload/remote receipt have not occurred, Meta identity/default-branch artifact remains unverified, and owner-accepted backup/restore drill is outstanding.

- Cross-run history restoration now has mocked API integration tests for valid artifact retrieval, malformed archive failure, HTTPS enforcement and bounded archive size. Same-day retained packages are reused exactly; conflicting same-date artifacts fail closed. These are mocked tests, not proof of a real default-branch artifact restore.
- History remains bounded by GitHub's 14-day artifact retention, not a permanent editorial database. The next authorized default-branch scheduled/manual run must verify real artifact restoration and deduplication.
- Latest npm audit on this tested candidate: 4 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical advisories involving `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common` and `uuid`; the available `googleapis` remediation is a major version upgrade and remains unmodified pending compatibility testing.
- Production acceptance remains blocked by real Meta Page verification, authorized live-post receipt, genuine media/licensing evidence and human review, live SonicVhibez OAuth/channel verification, explicitly authorized private upload and remote receipt, backup/restore owner acceptance, and live owner-reviewed YouTube history reconciliation remains required.
- No real Facebook post or YouTube upload is claimed. Do not merge, enable public publishing or perform external mutations without separate explicit owner authorization.

# Current branch status — 2026-10-24

- Verified code/test checkpoint: `4f144038aba80630494292ec63bc221535881459` on `codex/marketing-machine-audit-fixes`; base `main`: `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`. PR #1 was open, draft and unmerged; comparison at this checkpoint was 583 ahead, 0 behind.
- All checkpoint workflows passed: [automation — run 40090594392](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40090594392), [metadata — run 40090594361](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40090594361), [content quality — run 40090594384](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40090594384). Node tests: 133 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; automation also passed 8 Python safety tests and syntax/compilation checks. Verified CI install path: `npm ci --ignore-scripts`; plain `npm ci` remains unverified.
- Facebook implementation includes research-first draft ideas, authenticated dashboard UI/API, persistent state/audit, duplicate and one-post-per-local-day checks, source/license checksum gates, disclosure/high-impact claim/external-link checks, exact Selar campaign/pillar restrictions, artifact-bound approvals, live Meta scope/Page/task/token verification, gated Graph API scheduled text/photo publishing, image ffprobe/checksum validation, durable attempts, remote refetch and interrupted-attempt reconciliation. It is disabled by default: `publishingEnabled=false`, `dryRun=true`, `FACEBOOK_PUBLISH_ENABLED=NO`. No real Meta account was verified and no Facebook post was published.
- npm audit remains 4 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical advisories involving `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common`, and `uuid`.

## Current owner-controlled production blockers

1. Securely configure `META_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, the exact Page ID in config and `NATURE_FRONTIERS_FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID`; run read-only Meta permission/Page verification and review the returned scopes, Page task, ID and token match.
2. Keep Facebook publishing kill switches disabled until the owner explicitly authorizes a real test post. Any real scheduled operation requires current human approval, per-operation confirmation, durable attempt record and remote receipt verification.
3. Supply `CHANNEL_HISTORY_RECONCILIATION_PATH` containing every SonicVhibez remote video ID, format, actual timestamp and visibility; verify the authenticated uploads playlist is complete and resolve every pending/uncertain upload attempt.
4. Supply genuine rights-cleared YouTube media, narration, music, manifests/provenance/checksums, and complete full-file decode and human playback/caption/thumbnail review.
5. Complete final-hash-bound rights/editorial approval, secure live OAuth verification of SonicVhibez, then explicitly authorize one private-only upload and verify its remote ID/receipt.
6. Run and record owner-controlled restart and backup/restore acceptance.
7. Supply exact Safari HTTPS destination, truthful disclosure and explicit owner approval.
8. Resolve four moderate npm advisories through tested compatible upgrades or a documented risk decision.

No live Facebook post, YouTube upload, public publishing or production acceptance is claimed by these CI results.

# Release evidence snapshot — prior checkpoint cb6ca43b7723d903c3e6b78fd3ed662a13498b04 (2026-10-24)

This section records evidence from the preceding branch checkpoint; the commit containing this correction is documentation-only and is not covered by the run links below. All links below identify their historical checkpoint explicitly. See PR #1 for the live branch HEAD and exact current-HEAD workflow links. This is not production acceptance.

- At the preceding evidence checkpoint the implementation branch was `codex/marketing-machine-audit-fixes`, based on `main` at `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`. Re-fetch live refs from PR #1 before relying on current counts. PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged. The last code/test checkpoint remains `703a7d380a63f0d379ca17f0b920279597ea58be`.
- At checkpoint `586e5404ceabf399375e59fc0adad95389367408`, the following PR workflows succeeded: [automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084868763), [metadata validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084868753), [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084868796). The lockfile verification run is [40084865929](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084865929). The lockfile workflow ran `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, 112 Node tests, schedule/campaign validators and syntax checks; it did not execute the lockfile refresh/commit steps because no refresh was needed.
- The automation log at checkpoint `586e5404ceabf399375e59fc0adad95389367408` reports 112 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; Python safety tests: 8 passed. Campaign validation passed, 16 queued topics were held for review, public publishing was disabled, and JavaScript/Python syntax checks passed.
- The automation install at that checkpoint used `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (46 packages added, 47 audited). Plain `npm ci` without `--ignore-scripts` has not been verified.
- Current npm audit: 4 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical. Affected packages/ranges reported by the audit: `gaxios` 6.4.0–6.7.1 (via `uuid`); `googleapis` 33.0.0–149.0.0 (via `googleapis-common`); `googleapis-common` <=7.2.0 (via `uuid`); `uuid` <11.1.1 (v3/v5/v6 buffer bounds-check advisory). npm reports the available `googleapis` fix as 178.0.0, a major upgrade. Do not upgrade blindly; evaluate runtime compatibility and rerun the full suite. Dependency tree is not vulnerability-free.
- Production acceptance remains **BLOCKED**: the rolling cycle and fail-closed history gate are implemented but live channel history/OAuth have not been accepted; genuine assets, retained rights evidence and final-hash human review are absent; one explicitly authorized private upload/remote receipt is unverified; owner-run restart/backup/restore acceptance is outstanding. Safari remains inactive pending exact HTTPS destination, truthful disclosure and explicit owner approval.
- Public publishing remains disabled. GitHub Actions success does not prove that scheduled workflows are active on `main`, and does not prove production media, real rights, live OAuth, upload acceptance or restore acceptance.
- The malformed content-quality URL formerly in PR #1 was corrected to run [40084868796](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084868796).

# Go-live blockers — SonicVhibez Marketing Machine

## Current publication-spacing control — 2026-10-24

Tuesday/Saturday cron slots are draft-preparation triggers only, not a publication cadence. Actual uploads are gated by the rolling long-form → long-form → Short cycle, 72 elapsed hours from the latest actual publication, complete remote history reconciliation, and a clear upload-attempt ledger. Public publishing remains disabled.


**Acceptance status: BLOCKED for real media release and live YouTube acceptance.** Code and mock tests do not substitute for real rights evidence, media inspection or remote upload verification.

Last review: 2026-10-24. PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged. Public publishing remains disabled.

| Gate | Status | Owner action | Evidence required to close |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real media | BLOCKED | Supply genuine wildlife footage, narration and any music with permission for commercial YouTube use. | Actual rendered Short and long-form MP4s, real thumbnails/captions, SHA-256 values, ffprobe output, full decode and human playback inspection. |
| Production manifests | BLOCKED | Populate `content/render-manifest.json` and `content/long-form-render-manifest.json` using real existing files; do not promote example placeholders. | Both manifests reference existing, non-empty, validated inputs. |
| Rights | BLOCKED pending owner evidence | Retain original licence/permission documents; verify platform/commercial permissions, attribution, restrictions and expiry per asset. | Evidence files and checksums, source checksums, actual verifier identity and timestamp. A filename or checkbox is not proof. |
| Human review | BLOCKED pending production artifacts | Review exact video, thumbnail, captions, metadata, factual claims, disclosures and synthetic/altered-media flags. | Authenticated decision bound to the final video, thumbnail, caption, metadata and rights-evidence hashes, timestamp and rejection reason where applicable. |
| YouTube identity | BLOCKED | Securely configure `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN` and independently confirmed `SONICVHIBEZ_CHANNEL_ID` in a secret store/environment. Never paste secrets into chat. | Authenticated API confirms channel title exactly `SonicVhibez` and channel ID matches configured ID. |
| Live private upload | BLOCKED | After all gates pass, explicitly authorize one private upload; set `CONFIRM_PRIVATE_UPLOAD=YES` only for that operation. | Durable pre-upload attempt, remote video ID, re-fetched remote ownership/private visibility, durable receipt. |
| Safari affiliate | INACTIVE by design | Supply exact HTTPS destination and disclosure if wanted; preview and explicitly approve. | Exact destination, disclosure and owner approval. Until then Safari stays inactive. |
| Plain `npm ci` | NOT VERIFIED | Review install-script effects and run plain `npm ci` in a clean environment if required. | Captured command exit code and output. The evidenced install path is `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. |
| Rolling publication cycle | PASS — AUTOMATED POLICY / BLOCKED — OWNER ACTION FOR LIVE RELEASE | Configuration, queue validation and pre-upload gate require long-form → long-form → Short, at least 72 elapsed hours between consecutive actual publications, and at least 216 hours across three cyclic gaps. Tuesday/Saturday are draft-preparation triggers only. | Provide complete owner-reviewed channel-history reconciliation and resolve all pending/uncertain attempts; live OAuth and a separately authorized private upload remain required. |
| Operator runtime acceptance | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Run clean local startup, authenticated API checks, restart-persistence and backup/restore. | Captured health/readiness results and persisted-state/restore checks. Automated integration tests alone are not operator acceptance. |

## Non-negotiable controls

- SonicVhibez only; never use Nature Frontiers as the YouTube target.
- Public publishing remains disabled. No public/unlisted upload or unattended public scheduling.
- Preserve the exact Selar destination: `https://selar.com/0u19v8u99l`.
- Never blindly retry an uncertain upload; reconcile the existing attempt with YouTube first.
- Keep PR #1 open, draft and unmerged unless the owner separately authorizes a merge.

## Latest verified code/test checkpoint — 2026-10-24

The code/test commit `62b1bd599d63c3ab1d55b6a6660740fbf3d44157` passed all three GitHub Actions validation workflows with 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped in each: [automation validation and clean install](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495157), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495128), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495162). The automation run completed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (46 packages added, 47 audited) and Python compilation.

The later documentation checkpoint `b505a260570afb23de637d599868e55376a827aa` also passed all three workflows with 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped: [automation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034769), [metadata/schedule](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034706), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034728). It was documentation-only relative to the tested code/test commit.

The implemented safeguards include: full production preflight at dashboard readiness; required operator identity in audit events; rights-record hash verification and rechecking retained source/licence file checksums before upload; checksummed backup/restore of state, audit history, rights records, review approvals, upload attempts and receipts; and fail-closed refusal to overwrite a different upload ledger. `.gitignore` excludes local secrets, state, rights records, backups and generated media.

These are automated/code-level checks, not proof of genuine licence authenticity, human playback review, real wildlife renders or a live YouTube upload. Public publishing remains disabled; PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged.

## Remaining owner-controlled blockers

- Genuine rights-cleared wildlife footage, narration/music and complete Short/long-form manifests.
- Actual media render, ffprobe/full-decode evidence and human playback/editorial review.
- Securely configured and independently verified SonicVhibez OAuth channel identity.
- Explicit per-operation authorization for one private upload, then remote private-status verification and durable receipt.
- Separate operator-run restart and backup/restore acceptance.
- Safari remains inactive until its exact HTTPS destination, disclosure and owner approval are supplied.



## Current branch checkpoint — 2026-10-24

Branch HEAD at the latest verified documentation checkpoint: `54680587e71b5c84074a2c681ed8e95d919a87fd`. The three PR validation workflows passed on this exact SHA: [automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079578167), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079578180), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079578198). Each reported 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. The automation workflow verified `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and Python compilation. The metadata workflow deliberately verifies that production checks fail closed while production metadata is incomplete; it is not a production-readiness pass.

These CI results do not close owner-controlled media, rights, human playback, OAuth/channel identity, private upload, or operational restore gates. PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged; public publishing remains disabled. Recheck this section against the current HEAD before relying on it after future commits.


## Latest verified implementation checkpoint — 2026-10-24

- Historical checkpoint only: `4ba995bc51ed2ae0513bc312865713a73e0e3160`. This predates the rolling-cycle and history-gate changes and is **not** current release evidence; check the exact latest branch HEAD and its CI before acceptance.
- [Automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305593), [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305540), and [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305556) all passed on that code HEAD. Each ran 106 tests: 106 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. Automation also passed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (46 packages added, 47 audited) and Python safety tests. Metadata validation explicitly confirms that `npm run check` fails closed while real production metadata is incomplete; this is not a release-readiness pass.
- Tuesday/Saturday are draft-preparation triggers only. The rolling publication cycle is long-form → long-form → Short with at least 72 elapsed hours between actual publications. The pre-upload gate requires complete remote public/private/unlisted history and reconciliation of uncertain attempts; live acceptance remains blocked until owner evidence and authorization are supplied.
- PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged. Public publishing remains disabled. No production MP4, thumbnail, rights clearance, human playback acceptance, live OAuth identity check, private upload receipt, or owner-run restore acceptance is claimed.
- Remaining owner-controlled gates: genuine rights-cleared source assets and completed manifests; rendered/decoded media and human review; secure OAuth identity verification for SonicVhibez; explicit per-operation private-upload authorization; operational backup/restore acceptance. Safari remains inactive until exact destination, disclosure, and owner approval exist.


## Current implementation delta — rolling publication cycle

The authoritative configuration and queue use the rolling `long_form → long_form → short` sequence, 72 elapsed hours between consecutive actual publications, and 216 hours minimum across the three cyclic gaps; Tuesday/Saturday remain draft-preparation slots only. The upload evaluator now excludes reconciled successful ledger receipts from future-slot checks (remote history remains authoritative), and the uploader uses a cross-process exclusive lock to prevent simultaneous private-upload attempts. A process crash leaves a stale lock that fails closed and requires operator reconciliation rather than automatic deletion. Live uploads still require complete owner-reviewed remote history and unresolved-attempt reconciliation. Automated tests do not constitute live OAuth or upload acceptance.


**Evidence freshness note (2026-10-24):** exact tested code SHA `e86f715ee52522964e2864aead890b8bedf94395` passed all three code/test workflows linked at the top of this document (159 Node tests in each, 0 failures/skips; 8 Python safety tests in Automation validation). Older SHAs and counts elsewhere are historical checkpoints only. The Facebook workflow skip is not live default-branch acceptance.
