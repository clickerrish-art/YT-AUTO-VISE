# Release gate checklist

## Live release assessment — 24 October 2026

**Latest application-code candidate:** `df5d28560a757fb185a020982f981fb1ce6722c7` (Google API client dependency and lockfile upgrade). Exact-head checks passed on `36b9e34285a9becb3ad3305f1147b5e831d7bf16`, a documentation-only descendant containing the same application code and dependency tree.
**PR #1:** [open, draft, unmerged](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/pull/1).
**Branch comparison at exact test head `36b9e34285a9becb3ad3305f1147b5e831d7bf16`:** 896 commits ahead, 2 behind `main`; 94 changed files; merge base `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`; `main` HEAD `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6`. Do not merge, reset, force-push, or rewrite divergent history without the owner's explicit decision.

### Exact-SHA evidence

- [Automation validation — run 40125752411](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40125752411): **PASS** on exact test head `36b9e34285a9becb3ad3305f1147b5e831d7bf16`; **206 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**; Python safety tests: **8 passed**; 16 queued topics passed safe-state/destination checks; campaign validation, JavaScript syntax and Python compilation passed. A clean isolated normal lifecycle-script `npm ci` passed and `googleapis` imported successfully.
- [Metadata validation — run 40125752409](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40125752409): **PASS** on the same exact test head.
- [Content quality — run 40125752405](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40125752405): **PASS** on the same exact test head.
- [Locked install/lockfile validation — run 40125748862](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40125748862): **PASS** on the same exact test head; clean locked installation and configuration checks passed.
- [Production-readiness diagnostic — run 40125752527](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40125752527): **BLOCKED as intended** because mandatory production prerequisites remain unresolved. The `sonicvhibez-readiness-report` artifact was retained (artifact ID `12573171174`; expires 23 November 2026). This is not a readiness pass.
- [Nature Frontiers Facebook draft — run 40125752399](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40125752399): **SKIPPED** on the pull-request event. No default-branch draft or retained default-branch artifact is established by this run.

### Implemented in this audit

- The read-only readiness CLI exits with status 2 when mandatory gates are blocked and prints the complete blocker report; it exits 0 only when checks find no blockers.
- The dashboard readiness parser accepts the explicit blocked status and preserves actionable blockers rather than collapsing them into a generic validator error.
- The production-readiness workflow uses Node.js 24, runs for relevant pull-request paths, retains its diagnostic artifact, and fails the readiness gate while production prerequisites remain blocked.
- Pull-request validation workflows check out the exact pull-request head SHA rather than GitHub's synthetic merge ref. The automation workflow also verifies a normal lifecycle-script install in a clean temporary checkout with no credentials in its environment.
- Publication minimum spacing is configuration-driven across schedule validation, readiness checks, dashboard checks and the pre-upload history gate. The default remains 72 hours. The configured value must be finite, positive and at most 8,760 hours; cycle duration must equal the configured gap multiplied by the three-item cycle, and schedule, queue and spacing policy must agree. A regression test confirms a consistent 96-hour configuration is accepted.
- Upgraded `googleapis` from `^144.0.0` to `^188.0.0`; the lockfile now resolves `googleapis 188.0.0`, `gaxios 8.3.2` and `googleapis-common 9.3.1`. Exact-head npm audit reports **0 vulnerabilities** across all severities. The four previously reported moderate advisories are resolved in the audited lockfile; live OAuth/API account acceptance remains unverified.
- Publication cadence remains a rolling `long_form → long_form → short` cycle; the default 72-hour gap means at least 216 hours across three cyclic gaps. Tuesday/Saturday triggers are draft preparation only; no three-posts-per-week promise is made.

### Branch-divergence reconciliation

The live comparison is 896 ahead / 2 behind at the exact test head, with merge base `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`. The two base-only commits are file-only test churn: `71578dafc24e5d48173dce3f4e392e18e42aa40e` added `test/restore-facebook-draft-history.test.mjs` (117 lines), and `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6` removed that same test file. They do not change runtime code. The implementation branch lacks this dedicated test file; owner review should decide whether to reintroduce its cross-run history-restoration coverage as a separately reviewed test. No merge, reset, force-push or history rewrite was performed.

### Current acceptance register

| Gate | Status | Evidence / next action |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js automated tests | PASS | 206 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped on exact test head. |
| Python safety tests | PASS | 8 passed on exact test head. |
| Campaign, queue, schedule, syntax and compilation checks | PASS | Exact-head automation workflow above. |
| Normal lifecycle-script installation | PASS | Isolated clean checkout, no credentials, normal `npm ci`, and `googleapis` import passed. |
| Dependency audit | PASS | `npm audit`: 0 info, 0 low, 0 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical; total 0. |
| Configurable publication spacing | PASS | Default 72 hours; schedule, queue, dashboard, readiness and upload history gate use the validated configured value. |
| Readiness reporting fails closed | PASS | CLI returns status 2 with actionable blockers; dashboard returns HTTP 503 while mandatory production prerequisites are missing. |
| Clean-start dashboard/browser acceptance | NOT RUN | Exercise every visible control, authentication failure, API persistence, restart and error paths using the real app. |
| Real Short and long-form production media | OWNER ACTION REQUIRED | Supply genuine assets, completed manifests, rights evidence, checksums, full renders, full-file decode reports and human playback review bound to final hashes. |
| YouTube OAuth and channel identity | OWNER ACTION REQUIRED | Configure secrets securely, verify authenticated channel is SonicVhibez, retrieve complete public/private/unlisted history and reconcile uncertain attempts. |
| Private upload | OWNER ACTION REQUIRED | No live upload attempted. Require one-operation authorization, durable pre-insert ledger, private-only request and remotely verified private receipt. |
| Facebook integration | OWNER ACTION REQUIRED | Verify Nature Frontiers Page identity, token scopes and default-branch draft/artifact retention; live publishing remains disabled. |
| Backup/restore/restart drill | OWNER ACTION REQUIRED | Perform isolated restore and interruption/restart/concurrency tests; retain logs and checksums. |
| Branch divergence/test-file incident | OWNER ACTION REQUIRED | Review whether to restore the dedicated test coverage; no history rewrite or merge performed. |
| Production acceptance | BLOCKED | Mandatory media, identity, integration, recovery and owner-approval gates remain open. |

**Safety defaults:** public and unattended YouTube publishing remain disabled; a private upload requires explicit operation-specific authorization; Facebook live publishing remains disabled with dry-run and emergency-stop safeguards; the only approved Selar destination is `https://selar.com/0u19v8u99l`; Safari affiliate campaigns remain inactive.

**Verdict:** automated code checks and dependency audit pass on the stated exact test head; **CODE-LEVEL ACCEPTANCE REMAINS BLOCKED** pending remaining runtime verification. **PRODUCTION ACCEPTANCE IS BLOCKED.**

## Historical checkpoint material


- Tested code SHA: `bb9c8d115979ab5aff48ed0ee3ca9afe1bc0fd05`; implementation branch `codex/marketing-machine-audit-fixes`.
- PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged: https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/pull/1.
- Branch comparison at this checkpoint: 746 commits ahead, 2 behind `main`; base HEAD `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6`. Preserve the accidental test-file add/delete incident for owner review; no merge or history rewrite was performed.
- Exact-SHA CI passed:
  - Automation validation [run 40100702894](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40100702894): 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed/skipped; 8 Python safety tests passed; `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, campaign/queue checks, JavaScript syntax and Python compilation passed.
  - Content quality [run 40100702959](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40100702959): 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed/skipped.
  - Metadata validation [run 40100702955](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40100702955): 160 Node tests passed, 0 failed/skipped; schedule validation, readiness and captions checks passed.
  - Nature Frontiers daily Facebook draft [run 40100702958](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40100702958): skipped on the PR branch; not default-branch acceptance.
- Rolling publication policy: `long_form → long_form → short`; minimum 72 elapsed hours between consecutive actual publications and 216 hours across the three cyclic gaps. Tuesday/Saturday triggers are draft preparation only. Completed ledger receipts are not re-counted as future slots; an exclusive upload lock prevents concurrent inserts and fails closed after a crash.
- Live uploads now require a separate one-shot authorization bound to the job ID, final video hash, metadata hash, approval hash and verified channel ID. Authorization ID is persisted before insert and cannot be reused. This automated gate does not replace live owner credentials, rights evidence or human approval.
- All eleven inspected workflows now use `actions/checkout@v7` and `actions/setup-node@v7` where applicable, with Node.js 24 and setup-node caching explicitly disabled. Package engine floor is Node.js >=22. The exact SHA above passed on those updated actions.
- Dependency audit remains 4 moderate, 0 high/critical: `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common`, `uuid`. No unsafe major dependency upgrade was applied.
- CI installation used `npm ci --ignore-scripts`; unrestricted lifecycle-script installation was not tested.
- Production acceptance remains BLOCKED: required real short/long manifests and asset register are absent, `media/next-short.mp4` is absent, genuine licence evidence and human final-hash playback approval are not available, live SonicVhibez OAuth/history reconciliation and a separately authorized private upload/remote receipt have not occurred, Meta identity/default-branch artifact remains unverified, and owner-accepted backup/restore drill is outstanding.

# Release evidence snapshot — prior checkpoint cb6ca43b7723d903c3e6b78fd3ed662a13498b04 (2026-10-24)

This section records evidence from the preceding branch checkpoint; the commit containing this correction is documentation-only and is not covered by the run links below. See PR #1 for the live branch HEAD and exact current-HEAD workflow links. This is not production acceptance.

- At the preceding evidence checkpoint the implementation branch was `codex/marketing-machine-audit-fixes`, based on `main` at `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`. Re-fetch live refs from PR #1 before relying on current counts. PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged. The last code/test checkpoint remains `703a7d380a63f0d379ca17f0b920279597ea58be`.
- At checkpoint `586e5404ceabf399375e59fc0adad95389367408`, the following PR workflows succeeded: [automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084868763), [metadata validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084868753), [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084868796). The lockfile verification run is [40084865929](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084865929). The lockfile workflow ran `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, 112 Node tests, schedule/campaign validators and syntax checks; it did not execute the lockfile refresh/commit steps because no refresh was needed.
- The automation log at checkpoint `586e5404ceabf399375e59fc0adad95389367408` reports 112 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; Python safety tests: 8 passed. Campaign validation passed, 16 queued topics were held for review, public publishing was disabled, and JavaScript/Python syntax checks passed.
- The automation install at that checkpoint used `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (46 packages added, 47 audited). Plain `npm ci` without `--ignore-scripts` has not been verified.
- Current npm audit: 4 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical. Affected packages/ranges reported by the audit: `gaxios` 6.4.0–6.7.1 (via `uuid`); `googleapis` 33.0.0–149.0.0 (via `googleapis-common`); `googleapis-common` <=7.2.0 (via `uuid`); `uuid` <11.1.1 (v3/v5/v6 buffer bounds-check advisory). npm reports the available `googleapis` fix as 178.0.0, a major upgrade. Do not upgrade blindly; evaluate runtime compatibility and rerun the full suite. Dependency tree is not vulnerability-free.
- Production acceptance remains **BLOCKED**: the rolling cycle and fail-closed history gate are implemented but live channel history/OAuth have not been accepted; genuine assets, retained rights evidence and final-hash human review are absent; one explicitly authorized private upload/remote receipt is unverified; owner-run restart/backup/restore acceptance is outstanding. Safari remains inactive pending exact HTTPS destination, truthful disclosure and explicit owner approval.
- Public publishing remains disabled. GitHub Actions success does not prove that scheduled workflows are active on `main`, and does not prove production media, real rights, live OAuth, upload acceptance or restore acceptance.
- The malformed content-quality URL formerly in PR #1 was corrected to run [40084868796](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084868796).

## Verified code/test checkpoint and documentation-refresh status — 2026-10-24

- The most recent code/test checkpoint is `703a7d380a63f0d379ca17f0b920279597ea58be`; it passed all three validation workflows: [automation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084232036), [metadata](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084232050), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084232178). Logs show 112 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; Python safety tests and syntax/compilation checks also passed.
- A subsequent documentation-only refresh on this branch updated the evidence sections. Its current branch HEAD and its own CI runs are recorded in PR #1; do not mistake the code/test checkpoint above for the documentation commit SHA.
- The [lockfile workflow](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40084228825) passed on the code/test checkpoint, including `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, Node tests, schedule/campaign validation and syntax checks. Plain `npm ci` without `--ignore-scripts` remains unverified.
- The latest verified automation audit reports four moderate npm advisories involving `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common` and `uuid`, with no high/critical findings. The available Google API client fix is a major version upgrade and needs compatibility testing. Do not describe dependencies as vulnerability-free.
- Production acceptance remains blocked by owner-supplied genuine rights-cleared media, full decode and human playback review bound to final hashes, secure live SonicVhibez OAuth identity verification, a complete owner-reviewed channel-history reconciliation, one explicitly authorized private upload with a remotely verified private-status receipt, and owner-run restart/backup-restore acceptance. Safari remains inactive until exact HTTPS destination, truthful disclosure and explicit owner approval exist.
- Public publishing remains disabled. The rolling `long_form → long_form → short` publication cycle requires at least 72 complete elapsed hours between each consecutive actual publication (216 hours minimum for three cyclic gaps). Tuesday/Saturday remains draft preparation only; it is not represented as publication cadence.

# Release gate checklist — SonicVhibez Marketing Machine

## Current publication-spacing control — 2026-10-24

Tuesday/Saturday workflow slots are draft-preparation triggers only. Publication follows the rolling `long_form → long_form → short` cycle with at least 72 complete elapsed hours between each consecutive actual publication; three cyclic gaps require at least 216 hours. The upload gate retrieves the authenticated uploads playlist and requires a complete owner-reviewed reconciliation of remote IDs, actual timestamps, formats and public/private/unlisted visibility, plus a clear attempt ledger. Missing history or unresolved attempts blocks upload. Public publishing remains disabled.


Keep each item unchecked until evidence has actually been inspected. Automated tests and mocks do not close real-world acceptance gates.

## Historical checkpoint — superseded by the current verified baseline above

The code/test commit `62b1bd599d63c3ab1d55b6a6660740fbf3d44157` passed all three GitHub Actions validation workflows with 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped in each: [automation validation and clean install](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495157), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495128), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079495162). The automation run completed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (46 packages added, 47 audited) and Python compilation.

The later documentation checkpoint `b505a260570afb23de637d599868e55376a827aa` also passed all three workflows with 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped: [automation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034769), [metadata/schedule](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034706), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079034728). It was documentation-only relative to the tested code/test commit.

The implemented safeguards include: full production preflight at dashboard readiness; required operator identity in audit events; rights-record hash verification and rechecking retained source/licence file checksums before upload; checksummed backup/restore of state, audit history, rights records, review approvals, upload attempts and receipts; and fail-closed refusal to overwrite a different upload ledger. `.gitignore` excludes local secrets, state, rights records, backups and generated media.

These are automated/code-level checks, not proof of genuine licence authenticity, human playback review, real wildlife renders or a live YouTube upload. Public publishing remains disabled; PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged.

## Repository and automation
- [ ] Re-fetch and record branch/PR head SHA; PR #1 remains open and unmerged.
- [ ] Public publishing remains disabled.
- [ ] `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npm test` pass on the candidate SHA; record exit codes and test counts.
- [ ] Run `npm run check`, `npm run validate:schedule`, `npm run validate:campaigns`, `npm run check:captions`, and `npm run readiness`; record outcomes.
- [ ] Workflow cron values agree with `config/weekly-content-plan.json`; schedules create drafts only.
- [ ] Dashboard starts on loopback with actual operator credentials; unauthenticated calls fail and authenticated actions persist/audit.
- [ ] Restart recovery, slot idempotency/conflict, and backup/restore are verified.

## Real production artifacts
- [ ] Both production manifests point to present, non-empty, validated source files.
- [ ] Each asset has retained original licence/permission evidence and checksums.
- [ ] Commercial YouTube use, attribution, restrictions and expiry were checked by an identified reviewer.
- [ ] Narration, captions, metadata and edit match; wildlife claims are fact-checked.
- [ ] Short: 50–60 seconds, 1080×1920, H.264/AAC, full-file decode and measurable audio.
- [ ] Long-form: 6–10 minutes, 16:9, supported video/audio codecs and full-file decode.
- [ ] Thumbnail is a real file derived from the final rendered artifact and has a checksum.
- [ ] Video, thumbnail, captions, metadata and rights-evidence hashes are recorded.
- [ ] Human playback inspection and synthetic/altered-media disclosure review are complete.
- [ ] Authenticated human approval binds the exact artifact hashes and current metadata/rights versions.

## Private YouTube upload
- [ ] OAuth credentials remain in a secure environment/secret store, never browser code or chat.
- [ ] Authenticated API confirms exact title `SonicVhibez` and independently confirmed channel ID.
- [ ] Artifact package and explicit per-operation operator confirmation are present.
- [ ] Durable upload attempt is written before remote insert.
- [ ] Request explicitly sets `privacyStatus: private`; no public/unlisted fallback.
- [ ] Exact remote video is re-fetched and channel ownership/private visibility verified.
- [ ] Durable receipt and ledger are persisted; uncertain outcomes are reconciled before retry.

## Campaign compliance
- [ ] Selar destination is exactly `https://selar.com/0u19v8u99l` with accurate visible disclosure.
- [ ] Safari remains inactive unless exact HTTPS destination, disclosure and owner approval are retained.
- [ ] No unsupported sales, SEO-score, monetization or wildlife-event claims.
- [ ] Nature Frontiers is never selected as a target.

**Decision: BLOCKED** if any required real-world gate remains unchecked. Passing mock tests never substitutes for a genuine render, rights verification, human review or remote private-upload verification.


## Current branch checkpoint — 2026-10-24

Branch HEAD at the latest verified documentation checkpoint: `54680587e71b5c84074a2c681ed8e95d919a87fd`. The three PR validation workflows passed on this exact SHA: [automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079578167), [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079578180), and [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40079578198). Each reported 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. The automation workflow verified `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and Python compilation. The metadata workflow deliberately verifies that production checks fail closed while production metadata is incomplete; it is not a production-readiness pass.

These CI results do not close owner-controlled media, rights, human playback, OAuth/channel identity, private upload, or operational restore gates. PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged; public publishing remains disabled. Recheck this section against the current HEAD before relying on it after future commits.


## Historical implementation checkpoint — superseded by the current verified baseline above

- Historical checkpoint only: `4ba995bc51ed2ae0513bc312865713a73e0e3160`. This predates the rolling-cycle and history-gate changes and is **not** current release evidence; check the exact latest branch HEAD and its CI before acceptance.
- [Automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305593), [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305540), and [metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40081305556) all passed on that code HEAD. Each ran 106 tests: 106 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. Automation also passed `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (46 packages added, 47 audited) and Python safety tests. Metadata validation explicitly confirms that `npm run check` fails closed while real production metadata is incomplete; this is not a release-readiness pass.
- Tuesday/Saturday are draft-preparation triggers only. The rolling publication cycle is long-form → long-form → Short with at least 72 elapsed hours between actual publications. The pre-upload gate requires complete remote public/private/unlisted history and reconciliation of uncertain attempts; live acceptance remains blocked until owner evidence and authorization are supplied.
- PR #1 remains open, draft and unmerged. Public publishing remains disabled. No production MP4, thumbnail, rights clearance, human playback acceptance, live OAuth identity check, private upload receipt, or owner-run restore acceptance is claimed.
- Remaining owner-controlled gates: genuine rights-cleared source assets and completed manifests; rendered/decoded media and human review; secure OAuth identity verification for SonicVhibez; explicit per-operation private-upload authorization; operational backup/restore acceptance. Safari remains inactive until exact destination, disclosure, and owner approval exist.


## Current release evidence snapshot — 2026-10-24

Current tested code candidate: `9dd102f9636a5ba71c797cf79c104d3616cbe14e`. Exact-SHA automation validation [40122567804](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40122567804) passed with advisories: 205 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; 8 Python safety tests passed; 16 queue topics validated; JavaScript syntax and Python compilation passed. Metadata [40122567802](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40122567802), content quality [40122567799](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40122567799), and locked installation [40122564222](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40122564222) passed. Daily Facebook draft [40122567717](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40122567717) was **SKIPPED** on the PR event and does not prove a default-branch artifact. The restore code now rejects symlinked destination paths before writing, with regression tests in `test/backup-restore.test.mjs`. Four moderate dependency advisories remain. This snapshot is historical for the tested code candidate; see [the current release register](GO_LIVE_BLOCKERS.md) for owner actions and production blockers. This docs-only update is not represented by the run links above; its exact-head CI is recorded in PR #1 after completion. Verdict: **CODE-LEVEL ACCEPTANCE BLOCKED; PRODUCTION ACCEPTANCE BLOCKED**.

## Addendum — regression restoration verification (24 October 2026, 20:10 UTC)

This addendum supersedes the earlier branch-count and test-file notes above where they conflict.

- Current implementation branch commit at the time of verification: `c507b63abfa336165865ad01cf6354ae50254f04`.
- [Automation validation run 40128537077](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40128537077) completed **PASS** on that exact SHA: **209 Node tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. This includes the restored `test/restore-facebook-draft-history.test.mjs` regression tests for successful cross-run artifact restoration, malformed-archive fail-closed behaviour, HTTPS-only API configuration and oversized-response rejection.
- [Production readiness run 40128537135](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40128537135) produced and retained a diagnostic artifact (artifact ID `12574685153`, expires 23 November 2026), then exited nonzero because mandatory production gates remain blocked. This is the intended fail-closed result, **not** production acceptance.
- The regression test was recovered from historical commit `71578dafc24e5d48173dce3f4e392e18e42aa40e` and committed separately; no merge, reset, force-push or history rewrite was performed.
- The branch now has **898 commits ahead, 2 behind** `main`, with **95 changed files**. Merge base remains `45352b73bb6cc4787b2a49988b575afb754ab627`; `main` was `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6` at this comparison.
- Browser-driven dashboard acceptance, genuine media and rights review, real YouTube OAuth/channel/history reconciliation, an explicitly authorized private upload, Facebook default-branch draft artifact verification, and owner-controlled recovery/restart drills remain **NOT RUN / BLOCKED**. No external post or upload was performed.

The above is CI evidence for commit `c507b63abfa336165865ad01cf6354ae50254f04`. Any later code or documentation commit requires its own exact-SHA checks before it can be described as the latest verified head. Production remains **BLOCKED**.


## Latest exact-candidate checkpoint — 24 October 2026

Candidate tested: `7490e0caa966861ba16a6af023fb45d0914d9a34`.

- PASS: [automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40129571307), 211 Node tests, 8 Python safety tests, 16 queued-topic checks, normal clean install and zero npm audit advisories.
- PASS: [metadata validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40129571317); [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40129571311).
- BLOCKED by design: [production readiness](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40129571315). Required live history, verified channel, genuine assets/rights and owner approvals remain unresolved.
- SKIPPED: [Facebook daily draft on PR event](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40129571331); default-branch artifact and Page identity are not verified.
- A dashboard UI contract regression test now guards against stale cadence text and derives day/format options from the backend schedule. This is not a substitute for browser-driven end-to-end testing.
- Still NOT RUN / OWNER ACTION REQUIRED: browser E2E; genuine fully decoded Short and long-form exports plus rights evidence and final-hash-bound approval; live SonicVhibez OAuth/channel/history verification; separately authorized private-upload receipt; real Nature Frontiers Page verification and retained default-branch draft; isolated restore/restart/concurrency/rollback drills.
- Safety state unchanged: public and unattended YouTube publishing disabled; Facebook live publishing disabled; only approved Selar URL is `https://selar.com/0u19v8u99l`; Safari remains inactive; no real upload/post occurred. PR #1 stays open, draft and unmerged.


## Browser acceptance and security checkpoint — 24 October 2026

Source candidate: `e1afbdc51745ef18e47f12a93629674c76dc73a0`.

- **PASS**: [Playwright Chromium browser E2E](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40130547249), 1 test. It connected to the actual local dashboard/backend, created and re-read a draft/job, verified duplicate rejection and blocked `/readyz`, and confirmed no horizontal page overflow at 375px.
- **PASS**: [automation validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40130550675): 211 Node tests, 8 Python safety tests, clean install, 16 queue topics and zero npm audit advisories.
- **PASS**: [metadata validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40130550684); [content quality](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40130550761).
- **BLOCKED by design**: [production readiness](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40130550732), due missing live account/history evidence, rights-cleared production media and approvals.
- **SKIPPED**: [Facebook draft PR run](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40130550704); a default-branch retained draft and verified Page identity are still missing.
- The first browser run caught a genuine mobile overflow from long unbroken Meta status messages. The CSS was repaired and the exact-source browser run passed. Playwright was upgraded from 1.55.0 after npm audit exposed high-severity advisories; version 1.64.1 and the refreshed lockfile audit clean.
- This local browser test does not prove live YouTube/Meta integrations, production media rights, a private upload, Facebook draft artifact on `main`, or owner-controlled recovery drills. Those gates remain outstanding; no external upload/post occurred.


### Git reconciliation remains a separate owner gate

The two base-only commits are `71578dafc24e5d48173dce3f4e392e18e42aa40e` (adds `test/restore-facebook-draft-history.test.mjs`) and `fa00d28e7f58911482686e4ad69fac9f4701a2e6` (reverts that exact file). The current `main` tree lacks this test; the implementation branch restores it at `c507b63abfa336165865ad01cf6354ae50254f04`, and the exact-candidate Node suite passes.

The implementation branch is 926 commits ahead and 2 behind; only the first 250 branch-only commit records are returned by GitHub’s comparison response, with repeated documentation/workflow commit subjects visible. A complete commit-by-commit history audit has **not** been completed. Do not reconcile history implicitly. Owner must review the 99-file tree diff and explicitly choose how to handle the divergent history before any merge/rebase/cherry-pick operation.
