# SonicVhibez Marketing Machine

Free-first, local-first content operations for the SonicVhibez YouTube channel. This repository manages draft scheduling, production jobs, compliance gates, human review, campaigns and a guarded private-only upload path.

**Public publishing is disabled. Nature Frontiers is not an authorized target.** The approved Selar destination is exactly `https://selar.com/0u19v8u99l`. Safari affiliate campaigns start inactive.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- FFmpeg and ffprobe with required filters/fonts for real rendering and thumbnail extraction
- Legitimately licensed footage/narration/music and retained rights evidence before any production release

## Setup

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
cp .env.example .env
```

Populate secrets only in your local environment or secure secret store; never commit them. Set:
- `DASHBOARD_OPERATOR_TOKEN`: random token, at least 24 characters
- `DASHBOARD_OPERATOR_ID`: actual operator identity for review and rights verification
- Optional `DASHBOARD_STATE_DIR`: durable local state directory
- For private upload only: `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and the independently confirmed `SONICVHIBEZ_CHANNEL_ID`

The dashboard refuses to start without its operator token and binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Do not expose it directly to the internet.

## Run the dashboard

```sh
DASHBOARD_OPERATOR_TOKEN='use-a-random-secret-of-at-least-24-characters' DASHBOARD_OPERATOR_ID='actual-operator-id' npm run dashboard
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. Keep the terminal running. The dashboard's actions operate on real local state and allowlisted server-side tasks. Missing manifests or rights-cleared media should result in a blocked job, not a fake success.

## Schedule

Source of truth: `config/weekly-content-plan.json`.

- Tuesday, 17:00 Africa/Johannesburg: long-form draft, 6–10 minutes, 16:9
- Thursday, 17:00 Africa/Johannesburg: long-form draft, 6–10 minutes, 16:9
- Saturday, 17:00 Africa/Johannesburg: Short draft, 50–60 seconds, 9:16
- GitHub Actions uses 15:00 UTC and creates drafts only.

## Useful commands

```sh
npm test
npm run validate:schedule
npm run validate:campaigns
npm run check:captions
npm run readiness
npm run render:short
npm run render:long
npm run validate:short-export -- media/next-short.mp4
npm run validate:long-export -- media/long-form-next.mp4
npm run preflight:media -- media/next-short.mp4 content/next-short.json
npm run render:thumbnail -- media/next-short.mp4 'Reviewed title' media/next-short-thumbnail.jpg
npm run upload:private -- content/next-short.json media/next-short.mp4
```

Rendering requires real manifests, audio, captions, footage and rights evidence. Examples are deliberately blocked until replaced with verified information. Upload requires a persisted artifact-bound approval, actual thumbnail file/checksum, `CONFIRM_PRIVATE_UPLOAD=YES`, valid OAuth credentials and a channel ID verified against the authenticated YouTube API. The uploader sets visibility to `private` and refuses blind retries.

## Test evidence

At code and regression-test commit `9c89e46c138f1b277de7efb5580fbaa4008d22c5`, all three GitHub Actions validation workflows passed: 96 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- [Automation validation and clean install](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40078354250) — `npm ci --ignore-scripts` passed; 46 packages added, 47 audited; JavaScript tests and Python compilation passed.
- [Metadata/schedule validation](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40078354339) — 96/96 tests passed.
- [Content quality checks](https://github.com/clickerrish-art/YT-AUTO-VISE/actions/runs/40078354256) — 96/96 tests passed.

The dashboard `/readyz` endpoint runs the full production-readiness preflight and returns HTTP 503 with actionable blockers when prerequisites are missing. The private uploader now checks that the approval-bound rights-record hash and retained source/licence files still match their checksums. Dashboard startup requires `DASHBOARD_OPERATOR_ID` so audit records identify the configured operator. These checks do not prove real media, genuine licence authenticity, human playback inspection or live YouTube upload. Public publishing remains disabled.

## Operations and recovery

See [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md), [docs/PROJECT_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md](docs/PROJECT_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md), [docs/GO_LIVE_BLOCKERS.md](docs/GO_LIVE_BLOCKERS.md), and [docs/RELEASE_GATE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_GATE_CHECKLIST.md). Back up the state directory and `run-logs/`; never retry an upload whose outcome is uncertain until the durable ledger and YouTube remote state have been reconciled. Keep PR #1 open and draft until all external prerequisites and live acceptance criteria are genuinely met.
